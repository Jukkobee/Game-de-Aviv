Monkey Vroom Vroom

You are a monkey swinging on vines. The goal is to get as far as possible. There will be a global leaderboard, and the game will get progressively harder the farther you go. 

Some ways this will happen: 
while swinging back and forth on the vine, the pace increases (makes it harder to time a jump)
Obstacles appear (like a bird might fly by and you have to wait for it to pass/jump over it)
Jump distances will vary


Purpose:
	Entertaining game that engages the user by giving them a score every run. The leaderboard makes the game more addicting because there is a goal to reach; also, the score you get per run is important because it encourages the user to play again to get a higher score

Target audience: 
	All
Interests: 
	people that are bored and need something to do. Could be played in class (not in compsci though)


Functionality: You are a monkey swinging back and forth on a vine. You need to time a jump to grab the next vine to progress. The goal is to get as far as possible
Jump using space bar. Vine swinging is automatic (not controlled by player)
Bananas in the air give extra score, but requires a certain angle to jump at

Start screen: explanation of controls and goal. 

Death mechanic: only one life per run. When monkey falls, game over screen appears

HUD: current score, high score, all time leaderboard
