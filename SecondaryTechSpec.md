#Secondary Tech Spec

##Non-needed features, in order of highest priority to lowest

### randomness in vines' swing speed and length and distance between each other
#### game would be very boring if we didnt have this
### good physics (vine speed at jump, point at which vine is grabbed, initial direction of flight, etc) 
#### game would be very boring if we didnt have at least some extent of this
### Add obstacles in the way
#### I don't even know if I like the idea of this. I imagine the monkey swinging off a vine and into an obstacle that wasn't in view. How are you supposed to avoid them?
### Collision detection with obstacles
### Can play again after death
### Can be paused
